# ReactNative

ReactNative exercises I'm somewhat proud of, made during the Mobile Programming module.
<p>
<b>calculator</b>: The first very simple calculator <br />
<b>calculator2</b>: The second calculator, slightly improved <br />
<b>use-and-state</b>: Complete with notes that I made for myself when I was learning states and how to add items to lists <br />
<b>pressable</b>: Part of a group exercise in which each of us picked a thing about RN we hadn't learnt during the classes, then held a short presentation and showed example code and app. My part was about pressable.<br />
<b>RN-FishTableWithRest</b>: Consists of three different parts. rn-task08 is the ReactNative app that creates and shows lists; fishlist is the REST-service with java for saving and retrieving information; and fishtable.sql is the mysql dump.</p>

<p>Also see ReactNativeApp for some more advanced skills.</p>
