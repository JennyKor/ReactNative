# ReactNative

ReactNative exersices I'm somewhat proud of, made during the Mobile Programming module.
<p>
calculator: The first very simple calculator <br />
calculator2: The second calculator, slightly improved <br />
use-and-state: Complete with notes that I made for myself when I was learning states and how to add items to lists <br />
pressable: Part of a group project in which each of us picked a thing about RN we hadn't learnt during the classes, then held a short presentation and showed example code and app. My part was about pressable.<br />
RN-FishTableWithRest: Consists of three different parts. rn-task08 is the ReactNative app that creates and shows lists; fishlist is the REST-service with java for saving and retrieving information (do I hate java, or is it just Eclipse?); and fishtable.sql is the mysql dump.</p>

<p>Also see ReactNativeApp for some more advanced skills.</p>
