# ReactNative

<p>ReactNative exercises I'm somewhat proud of, made during the Mobile Programming module.</p>
<p>calculator</b>: The first very simple calculator </p>
<p>calculator2</b>: The second calculator, slightly improved </p>
<p>use-and-state</b>: Complete with notes that I made for myself when I was learning states and how to add items to lists </p>
<b>pressable</b>: Part of a group exercise in which each of us picked a thing about RN we hadn't learnt during the classes, then held a short presentation and showed example code and app. My part was about pressable.</p>
<p>RN-FishTableWithRest</b>: Consists of three different parts. rn-task08 is the ReactNative app that creates and shows lists; fishlist is the REST-service, with java for saving and retrieving information (basically one of the teacher's examples he supplied for us to use, has a few unneeded oddities if you look around); and finally, fishtable.sql is the mysql dump.</p>
